# QuickSites Router Strategy: Pages vs App Router

## âœ… Current Setup: Pages Router

QuickSites is currently built using **Next.js Pages Router** (`/pages` directory), which is fully functional and ideal for your current stack.

### Why itâ€™s OK to stay here for now:
- âœ… Simple routing, fast iteration
- âœ… Proven compatibility with Firebase/Supabase
- âœ… Works great for dashboards, admin tools, and API routes
- âœ… Supports `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and traditional client-side rendering

## ðŸš€ When to Consider Moving to App Router

You can consider upgrading in the future if you want:
| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| React Server Components | Reduced client JS, faster streaming |
| File-based layouts | Cleaner route structure |
| Parallel/sub-routing | Better multi-panel UIs |
| Edge-optimized rendering | Built for Vercelâ€™s evolving infra |
| Loading skeleton primitives | Built-in UX for streaming routes |

## ðŸ§  Strategic Recommendation

Stick with **Pages Router** through version 1.0.

You can re-evaluate after:
- Scaling to many user types (e.g. resellers, admin, editors)
- Needing shared layout state (multi-tab editors)
- Prioritizing edge streaming or SSR perf boosts

## ðŸ—‚ Suggested Migration Strategy (When Ready)

1. Enable the `/app` directory alongside `/pages`
2. Migrate one route at a time (`/admin` or `/templates`)
3. Use `<Link>` + `dynamic()` imports to gradually transition
4. Watch for changes in route behavior & data loading

## âœ… TL;DR

You're safe to keep shipping fast. Pages Router is 100% valid for QuickSites today.
When you're ready for RSC and layout magic â€” App Router will be waiting.
